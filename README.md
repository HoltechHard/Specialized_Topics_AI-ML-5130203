# Specialized_Topics_AI-ML-5130203  

1) Goals of Course  

The main purpose of the course is offer to the students of professional carreer **Интеллектуальные информационные системы и обработка данных** (Intelligent-information systems and data processing - 5130203/20101 and 20102), the capacity to have precise understanding about the theoretical fundamentals and technical-practical capabilities to implement models of the most known subfields of Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning), concluding with the integration of these AI-models into real use information systems.  

2) Organization of the lectures



3) Repository with materials  

The repository will contain all the slides of lectures and the necessary files to can complete the assigned tasks, and it will be updated each friday of the week.

4) Final project for Course  

For the completion of the final course project, the students will organize in groups of 3 students, which each one will play one or more of the next roles:  
  - Project Manager: responsible for structure the project, the definition of what technologies will be use (frameworks, libraries, databases, etc.), and redaction of the final report
  - Software Engineer: responsible for design the frontend of aplication and integration with backend and database
  - Machine Learning Engineer: responsible for machine learning operations (preprocessing, design of model architecture, training, testing, validation and inference process)

The students will need select one specific use case (financial, medical, comercial, educational, industrial, etc.) and fix this problem through the implementation of a small intelligent information system that contains frontend, backend, small database and AI-model. In the session of exams (сессия по зкзамене) each group will make presentation (доклад) of the next products:  
  - report between 4-8 pages (Responsible: Project Manager) in format of paper following the structure: 1- Problem Statement; 2- Methodology of Solution; 3- Results; 4- Conclusions;
  - information system (Responsible: Software Engineer) which contains frontend, and backend with conection with small database;
  - trained AI-model (Responsible: Machine Learning Engineer) with jupyter notebook source code, experiments of inference and performance results.
