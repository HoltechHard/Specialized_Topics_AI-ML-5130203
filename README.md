# Specialized_Topics_AI-ML-5130203  

1) Main Goals of Course  

The main purpose of the course is offer to the students of professional carreer **Интеллектуальные информационные системы и обработка данных** (Intelligent-information systems and data processing - 5130203/20101 and 20102), the capacity to have precise understanding about the theoretical/math fundamentals and technical-practical capabilities to implement models of the most known subfields of Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning), concluding with the integration of these AI-models into real useful information systems.  

2) Organization of the Lectures  

- First 10 lectures: Will be seletect 5 specialized AI and ML topics from document **list_topics.txt** distributed and discussed in 2 weeks with theory and practice in both;  
- Last 3 lectures: Laboratories about software implementation and integration of information system with AI-models.

3) Repository with Materials  

The repository will contain all the slides of lectures and the necessary files to can complete the assigned tasks, and it will be updated each friday of the week.  
Link of the repository:

4) Final Project for Course  

For the completion of the final course project, the students will organize in groups of 4 students, which each one will play one or more of the next roles:  
  - Project Manager: responsible for structure the project, the definition of the use-case problem and what technologies will be use (frameworks, libraries, databases, models, etc.), and redaction of the final report;
  - Software Engineer - Frontend: responsible for design the frontend development and validation of aplication;
  - Software Engineer - Backend: responsible for integration of frontend with backend and database;
  - Machine Learning Engineer: responsible for machine learning operations (preprocessing, design of model architecture, training, testing, validation and inference process)

The students will need select one specific use case with their respective dataset (financial, medical, comercial, educational, industrial, etc.) and fix this problem through the implementation of a small intelligent information system that contains frontend, backend, small database and AI-model. In the session of exams (сессия по зкзамене) each group will make presentation (доклад) of the next products:  
  - report between 4-8 pages (Responsible: Project Manager) in format of paper following the structure: 1- Problem Statement; 2- Methodology of Solution; 3- Results; 4- Conclusions;
  - information system (Responsible: Software Engineers) which contains frontend, and backend with connection with small database;
  - trained AI-model (Responsible: Machine Learning Engineer) with jupyter notebook source code, experiments of inference and performance results.

### Week 01 - Introduction to the fundamentals of AI (Lecture **The unstoppable rise of AI**)  

Homework (from 13.09 until 20.09):    
1) Analyze the slides in the file conference-ai-11-09-2024.pdf and do some more research by your own about the topics covered in the week 01. In a brief 1-page summary (in English pdf format and individually), comment on what you understood from the first class and select from the list of AI subfields described in slide 5, the topic which you think it's the most interesting for you and what previous knowledge and experience you have with this topic and expectations that you have related to what you will learn in your course.  
2) Define groups of 4 students and the roles that each student will play in the final project. Send the group list to Farida (leader of group 20101) and Kristina (leader of group 20102). ** It is not yet necessary to define the project topic, this will be defined in week 10 **.
