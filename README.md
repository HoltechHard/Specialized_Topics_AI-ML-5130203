# Specialized_Topics_AI-ML-5130203  

### Main Goals of Course  

The main purpose of the course is offer to the students of professional carreer **Интеллектуальные информационные системы и обработка данных** (Intelligent-information systems and data processing - 5130203/20101 and 20102), the capacity to have precise understanding about the theoretical/math fundamentals and technical-practical capabilities to implement models of the most known subfields of Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning), concluding with the integration of these AI-models into real useful information systems.  
  
### Repository with Materials  
  
The repository will contain all the slides of lectures and the necessary files to can complete the assigned tasks, and it will be updated each friday of the week.

### Lesson 04 - Machine Learning I: Classification  
---------------------------------------------------  
**Homework (from 26.10 until 06.11):**    
1) Choose 1 machine learning task: REGRESSION or CLASSIFICATION;
2) Select one dataset with tabular data structure, which contains numerical and categorical type of data (need both necessarily). Dataset need have minimum 500 rows and number of columns (features) min = 6 and max = 50. You can use your own datasets from your past projects, your company or take one of the public datasets in the most popular repositories UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets); Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or Google Dataset Search (https://datasetsearch.research.google.com). Your dataset can have format of file like .csv, .xls, .json, .sql, .data, .txt ... etc;  
3) In groups of 5 students, apply the entire pipeline of supervised learning, and get as result a benchmark of metrics for the task choosing 3 algorithms.
    
### Lesson 03 - Machine Learning I: Regression  
----------------------------------------------  
  
  
### Lesson 02 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning and Statistical Learning  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Homework (from 26.09 until 09.10):**    
  
1) Project of Statistical Analysis for tabular data
   - Take as template the jupyter notebook **lesson02/lab02.ipynb** worked in laboratory to make Statistical Analysis for Numerical and Categorical features;
   - Select one dataset with tabular data structure, which contains numerical and categorical type of data (need both necessarily). Dataset need have minimum 500 rows and number of columns (features) min = 6 and max = 50. You can use your own datasets from your past projects, your company or take one of the public datasets in the most popular repositories UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets); Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or Google Dataset Search (https://datasetsearch.research.google.com). Your dataset can have format of file like .csv, .xls, .json, .sql, .data, .txt ... etc;  
   - Publish your own statistical analysis project in Github repo. Need have 1 folder which contains the dataset files and 1 jupyter notebook file .ipynb, which contains the python source code;  
   - Define the Metadata, Load the dataset as dataframe and take care the missing values;  
   - Make Descriptive Statistical Analysis for Numerical Variables: plot histogram of frequencies, histogram of densities, box plot, calculate the statistical metrics, plot the correlation table of numerical features and detect outliers;  
   - Make Descriptive Statistical Analysis for Categorical Variables: plot bar chart with absolute frequencies for each instance using all categorical variables, plot the pie chart with relative frequencies for each instance using all categorical variables;  
   - Make Descriptive Statistical Analysis for Groups of Categorical Variables: choose 2 categorical variables of your dataset. Create groups using the instances of these 2 categories and count the number of samples for each of these combined instances. Plot the grouped absolute frequencies using bar chart and grouped relative frequencies using pie chart.
   - Using the Markdowns of jupyter after each drawn diagram, make a commentary in short words about the interpretation of this plot.
  
2) Report about Statistical Learning Theory (SLT)  
   - Read the paper titled **Statistical Learning Theory: Models, Concepts, and Results (von Luxburg, Scholkopf)** the topics 1, 2.1, 2.2 in google drive repository;  
   - Link of paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZBTLqKeAUFw5rPBX_9tHAv06gQbhyohe/view?usp=drive_link  
   - Make report of 1 page in pdf format (publish it in GitHub) explaining the problem of binary classification (in formal math way). Answer the question: How SLT offer math basic framework to solve the problem of binary classification in Machine Learning?  

### Lesson 01 - Introduction to the fundamentals of AI    
-------------------------------------------------------  
**Homework (from 13.09 until 20.09):**    
  
1) Analyze the slides in the file conference-ai-11-09-2024.pdf and do some more research by your own about the topics covered in the week 01. In a brief 1-page summary (in English pdf format and individually), comment on what you understood from the first class and select from the list of AI subfields described in slide 5, the topic which you think it's the most interesting for you and what previous knowledge and experience you have with this topic and expectations that you have related to what you will learn in our course.  
2) Define groups of 4 students and the roles that each student will play in the final project. Send the group list to Farida (leader of the group 20101) and Kristina (leader of the group 20102). **Still it's not necessary to define the project topic, this will define around week 9-10**.
    
### Organization of the Lectures  
---------------------------------    
- First 10 lectures (related with theory and labs): Will be seletect 5 specialized AI and ML topics from document **list_topics.txt** distributed and discussed in 2 weeks with theory and practice in both;  
- Last 3 lectures (related with final project): Laboratories about software implementation and integration of information system with AI-models.  
  
### Final Project for Course   
-----------------------------  
For the completion of the final course project, the students will organize in groups of 4 students, which each one will play one or more of the next roles:  
  - Project Manager: responsible for structure the project, the definition of the use-case problem and what technologies will be use (frameworks, libraries, databases, models, etc.), and redaction of the final report;
  - Software Engineer - Frontend: responsible for design the frontend development and validation of aplication;
  - Software Engineer - Backend: responsible for integration of frontend with backend and database;
  - Machine Learning Engineer: responsible for machine learning operations (preprocessing, design of model architecture, training, testing, validation and inference process)

The students will need select one specific use case with their respective dataset (financial, medical, comercial, educational, industrial, etc.) and fix this problem through the implementation of a small intelligent information system that contains frontend, backend, small database and AI-model. In the session of exams (сессия по зкзамене) each group will make presentation (доклад) of the next products:  
  - report between 4-8 pages (Responsible: Project Manager) in format of paper following the structure: 1- Problem Statement; 2- Methodology of Solution; 3- Results; 4- Conclusions;
  - information system (Responsible: Software Engineers) which contains frontend, and backend with connection with small database;
  - trained AI-model (Responsible: Machine Learning Engineer) with jupyter notebook source code, experiments of inference and performance results.
